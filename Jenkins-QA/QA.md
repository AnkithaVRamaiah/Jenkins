💡 **Example**:  
You can use the following to securely inject credentials into a pipeline:
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        MY_SECRET = credentials('my-secret-id')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo ${MY_SECRET}'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### **66. What are Jenkins' Build Triggers?**  
🔹 **Jenkins Build Triggers**:  
- **Build triggers** in Jenkins define when a job should run. Common triggers include SCM changes (like Git), schedule-based triggers (using cron syntax), and manual triggers (through the Jenkins interface).

💡 **Example**:  
You can set up a trigger to run a job when changes are pushed to a Git repository:
```groovy
triggers {
    githubPush()
}
```

---

### **67. What is Jenkins' Build Success/Failure Notifications?**  
🔹 **Build Success/Failure Notifications**:  
- Jenkins can notify users about build results through various channels, such as email, Slack, or other messaging systems. This is typically set up using plugins like **Email Extension Plugin** or **Slack Notification Plugin**.

💡 **Example**:  
You can configure Jenkins to send an email notification when a build fails:
```groovy
post {
    failure {
        mail to: 'developer@example.com',
             subject: "Build Failed",
             body: "Please check the Jenkins logs."
    }
}
```

---

### **68. How do you use Jenkins for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery?**  
🔹 **CI/CD with Jenkins**:  
- Jenkins supports both **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Delivery (CD)** by automating the build, test, and deployment processes. It pulls code from version control systems, triggers builds, runs tests, and deploys to environments in an automated pipeline.

💡 **Example**:  
You can set up a Jenkins pipeline to run tests after every commit (CI) and deploy to staging or production after successful tests (CD).

---

### **69. What is Jenkins' 'Post-build Actions'?**  
🔹 **Post-build Actions in Jenkins**:  
- **Post-build actions** are steps that Jenkins executes after a build has completed, regardless of whether it succeeds or fails. This includes actions like sending notifications, archiving artifacts, or triggering other jobs.

💡 **Example**:  
A common post-build action is to archive build artifacts:
```groovy
post {
    always {
        archiveArtifacts '**/*.jar'
    }
}
```

---

### **70. How do you handle failures in Jenkins pipelines?**  
🔹 **Handling Failures in Jenkins Pipelines**:  
- Jenkins allows you to define actions to take in the case of build failures using the `post` section in the pipeline. You can set actions such as sending notifications, rolling back deployments, or saving logs for debugging.

💡 **Example**:  
You can send an email notification upon failure:
```groovy
post {
    failure {
        mail to: 'admin@example.com',
             subject: "Build Failed",
             body: "Please review the build logs."
    }
}
```
---

### **71. What is Jenkins' Blue/Green Deployment?**  
🔹 **Blue/Green Deployment in Jenkins**:  
- **Blue/Green Deployment** is a strategy where two identical environments (blue and green) are set up. One environment (blue) is live, and the other (green) is idle. When a new version of the app is deployed, it’s deployed to the idle environment (green), and traffic is then switched to it. The previous environment (blue) is now idle and can be used for the next deployment.

💡 **Example**:  
You can set up Jenkins to deploy to the green environment first, test it, and then switch traffic to it:
```groovy
stage('Deploy to Green') {
    steps {
        sh 'deploy-to-green.sh'
    }
}
stage('Switch Traffic') {
    steps {
        sh 'switch-traffic-to-green.sh'
    }
}
```

---

### **72. What is Jenkins' Canary Deployment?**  
🔹 **Canary Deployment in Jenkins**:  
- **Canary Deployment** involves deploying the new version of an application to a small subset of users first (the "canary"). If everything works fine, it is gradually rolled out to the rest of the users. This allows for safer deployments and reduces the risk of impacting all users if something goes wrong.

💡 **Example**:  
In Jenkins, you can deploy to a small group of users first:
```groovy
stage('Deploy to Canary') {
    steps {
        sh 'deploy-to-canary.sh'
    }
}
stage('Gradual Rollout') {
    steps {
        sh 'deploy-to-rest-of-users.sh'
    }
}
```

---

### **73. What are Jenkins' Input and Output Parameters?**  
🔹 **Input and Output Parameters in Jenkins**:  
- Jenkins allows you to use **input** parameters (e.g., asking for user confirmation before proceeding) and **output** parameters (e.g., passing results from one stage to another).

💡 **Example**:  
Input parameters could be used to pause a pipeline until a user confirms the next step:
```groovy
stage('Deploy') {
    steps {
        input 'Deploy to production?'
    }
}
```

---

### **74. How do you handle timeouts in Jenkins?**  
🔹 **Timeouts in Jenkins**:  
- You can set **timeouts** for stages or steps to ensure that a pipeline does not hang indefinitely. Timeouts can be set globally or per stage, and Jenkins will abort the stage or pipeline if the time exceeds the defined limit.

💡 **Example**:  
To set a timeout for a stage:
```groovy
stage('Build') {
    steps {
        timeout(time: 30, unit: 'MINUTES') {
            sh 'mvn clean install'
        }
    }
}
```
